*/

let grades = [
    {name: 'John', grade: 8, sex: 'M'},
    {name: 'Sarah', grade: 12, sex: 'F'},
    {name: 'Bob', grade: 16, sex: 'M'},
    {name: 'Johnny', grade: 2, sex: 'M'},
    {name: 'Ethan', grade: 4, sex: 'M'},
    {name: 'Paula', grade: 18, sex: 'F'},
    {name: 'Donald', grade: 5, sex: 'M'},
    {name: 'Jennifer', grade: 13, sex: 'F'},
    {name: 'Courtney', grade: 15, sex: 'F'},
    {name: 'Jane', grade: 9, sex: 'F'}
]
