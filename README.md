# Lastest Javscript ES6 features

Learning core javascript feature to write good efficient readable code via scrimba.com
ES6 goal is to write less code but make it more readable at the same time.

### `09-March-2020`

Used string literals that makes concatenation and using variables much easy and looks clean.
Also destructuring of objects and Array.

### `14-March-2020`

Object literals, if inside the function the Key and property value has same name then we can directly use f(city){ const xyz = {city}} instead of f(city) { const xyz = {newCity:city} }

### `18-May-2020`

Revisioned promises , callbacks and new async await which is actually syntactical sugar for .then .catch to write synchronous code

### `20-May-2020`

Arrow vs Regular Functions, their scope, minimalistic approach and clean way to write functions
> ``` let xyz = () => { } AND function xyz() { } ```
