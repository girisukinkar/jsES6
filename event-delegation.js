// This concept suggests . if there is a parent with numerous amount of childs which has a click functionality
// Then instead of attaching a click handler to every child we must attach only one to the parent and make use of e.target to perform operations

//DEFINITIOn : The idea is that if we have a lot of elements handled in a similar way, then instead of assigning a handler to each of them â€“ we put a single handler on their common ancestor.
